# Thinking Functionally with C#
**Room:** Live Streaming

**Start Time:** 2024-03-22 15:30

Have you ever wanted to write C# code that's more supportable, robust and testable?  I can't think of any reason you wouldn't!  Functional programming is an alternative style of writing code to the Object-Oriented paradigm that most of us are taught at the beginning of our careers, and it's not only simpler to learn than OO, but also results in a better overall codebase.

In this talk, I'm going to not only show you what the Functional Programming paradigm is, but I'm also going to explain how you can adjust your thinking and approach to problem solving to work in a functional manner.

There won't be any hard theory or talk of list theory, just immediately useful, practical coding technique.
