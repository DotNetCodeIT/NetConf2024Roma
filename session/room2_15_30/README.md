# Build a Chatbot with Azure OpenAI and .NET 8
**Room:** Live in Rome 2

**Start Time:** 2024-03-22 15:30

I will showcase how to build a simple yet powerful chatbot using Azure OpenAI and .NET 8. The chatbot will be able to answer questions based on a provided PDF file without any explicit training. In my session, I built a chatbot using Azure OpenAI Service and .NET 8. Azure OpenAI gives access to OpenAI models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 right from the Azure cloud. These models can understand complex language tasks without any training data. We will use this capability to build a chatbot that can read and comprehend a PDF file. Users will be able to ask questions based on the content of the file, and the chatbot will respond with relevant answers.
