**Room:** Live Streaming

**Start Time:** 2024-03-22 11:30

AI is now everywhere and over the last couple of years, weâ€™ve learned how powerful language models can be. While these models are incredibly useful on their own, you can accomplish even more by integrating them with other systems and tools.
In this session we'll see new preview features that will permit you to use latest versions of  GPT models in conjunction with .NET 8 functions to unlock new possibilites. We'll see how can you create AI functions in .NET, how can you call them from an AI model and how the model can structure data outputs, all based on the functions you specify.
This session will give you lots of inputs to create AI integrations in your solutions and to enrich AI models with capabilities coming from your corporate systems.
