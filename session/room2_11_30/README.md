# I don't feel so wellâ€¦ Integrating health checks in your .NET solutions
**Room:** Live in Rome 2

**Start Time:** 2024-03-22 11:30

Do you have any idea how your ASP.NET Web Apps and APIs are functioning? Are they behaving healthily or in a degraded state? You might be able to tell from log information and telemetry data, but why not have them tell you how healthy they are themselves? ASP.NET Core introduced health endpoints that let your apps and APIs do just that. In this session you will learn how to make health checks an integral part of your solution. We will cover various types of health checks ranging from internal status, such as memory thresholds, to health based on external dependencies, such as databases and HTTP endpoints. Finally, you are going to see how this all can be used in a container cluster to allow the orchestrator to check for liveliness and readiness based on your health endpoints.
